#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n): No matter how big "A" becomes the while loop only does one operation of True or False. Arithmetic operations
have a time complecity of O(n).


b)O(n^2): There is a while loop nested in a for loop. The while loop needs to run for every element in the for loop the
of operations increases expotentially. 


c)O(n): No matter how may times it does a call stack the highest cost operation is arithmatic which has a time complexity of  O(n).
